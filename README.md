Some of the key points that have been covered include:
1. Varying font sizes of the text in the markdown cells using single #, double #, and more..
2. Latex formula for displaying math-related expressions in a user-readable format
3. Drawing 2*2 grid using horizontal(-) and vertical(|) bars, horizontal bars for seperating title from the data, vertical bars for seperating columns from one another
